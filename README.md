# VERYsimpleSQLconnectionAndInsertForm
This is a visual studio forms application that just simply shows how to connect to a SQL database (that has been given, just attach in SSMS) and a VERY simple way of inserting data into a table using forms textboxes and a SQL connection. 

Step 1: Extract the files for the database and attach the database to your SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio).
Step 2: Extract the SampleConnectionApp.zip.
Step 3: Simply open up the project and make sure your sqlagent is running in task manager.
